		<h1>Report</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome {{ USERNAME }}. This is a report generated by SustaiN for your
			experimental field. The map below is interactive and the overlayed colored
			image shows the status of the crops in terms of having the possibility of high
			or low Nitrogen level.

		<p>How to interpret this result:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The map generated by SustaiN simply highlights the relative amount of
				Nitrogen in crop canopies with respect to your defined area. In future, we
				might be able to predict the actual amount of Nitrogen.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use the variation of color (blue to red) within your defined area to
				identify anomalies and take necessary management action for that
				particular area.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you think that the acquisition date of the image you got is too early
				than what you originally gave, that is probably due to the selection of
				date range in Step 2. Reduce the range to get images closer to your actual
				selected date. However, be advised that the image might be affected by
				cloud and other visibility issues.
			</li>
